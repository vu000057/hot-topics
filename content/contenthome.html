        <p>What is the Value of Money? It is hard to define in few sentences. My father often says that money is only valuable when it is spent wisely on right things and at right time.</p>
        <p>The value of money is determined by the demand for it, just like the value of goods and services. Money is merely an arbitrary store of value. It is not value itself. In life, there are many stores of value such as: time, knowledge, happiness, etc. Money is often just the vehicle of interchanging these various forms of value with one another.</p>
        <p>Most of us, to a certain degree, associate a lot of our self-worth and identity to our job and how much money we make. It is, quite literally, a market valuation of our skills and competence as a person, and therefore we all get a little bit testy and scooch around uncomfortably in our chairs whenever money is brought up.</p>
        <p>Money is fluid. Its value only becomes realized when it’s put into motion. Therefore, money is a reflection of the owner’s values and intentions. Some spends on nice clothes, nice houses, etc. Others spend on travelling, learning , etc. Some doesn't want to spend at all. And, some spends a lot helping other people.</p>
        <p>In general, the value of money is determined by many different factors. One of the most significant ones is how it is spent to improve our life quality.</p>

    <h3>GMO FOOD - Is It Really Safe?</h3>

        <p>GMOs—or genetically modified organisms—are created in a lab by altering the genetic makeup of a plant or an animal. Those who support using GMOs point out that Americans have been eating foods containing them for more than 15 years and that there’s no credible evidence that people have been harmed. But saying there’s no evidence of harm isn’t the same as saying they’ve been proved safe. “The contention that GMOs pose no risks to human health can’t be supported by studies that have measured a time frame that is too short to determine the effects of exposure over a lifetime,” says Robert Gould, M.D., president of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</p>
        <p>A joint commission of the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has established a protocol for evaluating the safety of GMOs, which it says have the potential to introduce toxins and new allergens (or increase levels of existing ones), or cause nutritional changes in foods and other unexpected effects. Other developed nations have used those guidelines in their mandatory premarket safety assessments for genetically modified organisms. But the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t require any safety assessment of genetically engineered crops, though it invites companies to provide data for a voluntary safety review.</p>
        <p>Animal studies—commonly used to help assess human health risks—have suggested that GMOs might cause damage to the immune system, liver, and kidneys. More studies are needed to determine long-term effects. And the ability of researchers to track potential health effects of GMOs in the human population is hampered by the absence of labeling. “Physicians need to know what their patients are eating,” Gould says. “If your patient has a problem with food allergies or other side effects that may be related to GMOs, it’s difficult to identify any links unless these foods are labeled.” </p>

        <p>Sometimes I am just not so sure whether the world will become a better or worse place in the next 80 years. Anyway, predicting the future is hard but interesting.</p>
        <p>Think 3D printers are amazing? Just wait until the arrival of molecular assemblers, a hypothetical fabricator described by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his seminal book, Engines of Creation. Drexler described a molecular assembler as a device capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product. If you’ve ever seen an episode of Star Trek in which a member of the crew uses a replicator to churn out a steaming hot cup of Earl Grey tea, then you’ve basically seen a molecular assembler, which some futurists refer to as fabricators, or fabs for short.</p>
        <p>In terms of housing, temporary stackable housing pods, underwater cities and 3D-printed houses bought "off the shelf" will also help alleviate the burden of overpopulation and inner city living-space shortages.Buildings with their own microclimates and cities built in the skies are also among the amazing feats of future engineering predicted by the panel, which includes Rhys Morgan, director of engineering and education at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London, award-winning architects Arthur Mamou-Mani and Toby Burgess, and urbanist Linda Aitken.</p>
        <p>But not only will tomorrow's architects continue to advance towards the clouds, building higher and higher, as engineering advances allow, but we'll also be headed deep below ground. The panel suggested future cities will feature incredible multi-level basement structures -- already beginning to make an impact in high-density areas like London -- which will help ease a lack of urban space above ground.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, commutes of the future will feature epic city-spanning bridges, according to the panel. Want to nip over to Mars quickly? No problem -- the experts are predicting spaceports will become commonplace, so future generations will be able to head over to their local station and hitch the next ride.</p>
